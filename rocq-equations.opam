synopsis: "A function definition package for Rocq"
description:
  "Equations is a function definition plugin for Rocq, that allows the definition of functions by dependent pattern-matching and well-founded, mutual or nested structural recursion and compiles them into core terms. It automatically derives the clauses equations, the graph of the function and its associated elimination principle."
