Equations provides a notation for writing programs by dependent
pattern-matching and (well-founded) recursion
in [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr). It compiles everything down to
eliminators for inductive types, equality and accessibility,
providing a definitional extension to the Coq kernel.
The plugin can be used with Coq's standard logic in `Prop`
for a proof-irrelevant, erasable interpretation of pattern-matching,
or with a polymorphic logic in `Type` or re-using the prelude
of the [HoTT/Coq](http://github.com/HoTT/HoTT) library for a
proof-relevant interpretation. In all cases, the resulting
definitions are axiom-free.

## Learning Equations

- You can discover and learn Equations through [interactive tutorials](https://coq.inria.fr/platform-docs/)
  directly in your browser, or locally with Equations installed.

## Documentation

- The [reference manual](http://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/raw/main/doc/equations.pdf)
  provides a summary of the commands and options, and a brief introduction.
  This introduction can also be followed interactively with Equations installed,
  [equations_intro.v](http://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/raw/main/doc/equations_intro.v)
  or [interactively in your browser](http://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/assets/jsexamples/equations_intro.html).

- A gallery of [examples](http://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/examples) provides more consequent
  developments using Equations.

## Installation

The latest version works with Coq 8.13 (branch
[8.13](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/tree/8.13)),
Coq 8.14 (branch
[8.14](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/tree/8.14)),
Coq 8.15 (branch
[8.15](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/tree/8.15)),
and the current Coq master branch (branch
[master](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/tree/master)).

See [releases](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations/releases) for
sources and official releases.

### Install with OPAM

This package is available on [OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org/).
Activate the [Coq repository](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html)
if you didn't do it yet:

    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released

and run:

    opam install coq-equations

To get the beta versions of Coq, activate the repository:

    opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev

To get the development version of Equations, activate the repository:

    opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev

### Install from source

Alternatively, to compile Equations, simply run:

    ./configure.sh
    make

in the toplevel directory, with `coqc` and `ocamlc` in your path.

Optionally, one can build the test-suite or examples:

    make examples test-suite

Then add the paths to your `.coqrc`:

    Add ML Path "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/src".
    Add Rec LoadPath "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/theories" as Equations.

Or install it:

    make install

As usual, you will need to run this command with the appropriate privileges
if the version of Coq you are using is installed system-wide, rather than
in your own directory. E.g. on Ubuntu, you would prefix the command with
`sudo` and then enter your user account password when prompted.

## HoTT Variant

The HoTT variant of Equations works with the coq-hott library for Coq 8.13 and up. When using `opam`, simply install first the `coq-hott` library and `coq-equations` will install its HoTT variant. From source, first
install `coq-hott` and then use:

    ./configure.sh --enable-hott

This will compile the `HoTT` library variant in addition to the standard one.
Then, after `make install`, one can import the plugin in Coq, using:

    From Equations Require Import HoTT.All.
