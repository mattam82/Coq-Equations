Inductive In {X} (x : X) : list X -> Type :=
| here {xs} : In x (x :: xs)
| there {y xs} : In x xs -> In x (y :: xs).
Derive Signature NoConfusion for In.
Notation " x ∈ xs " := (In x xs) (at level 70, xs at level 10).
Arguments here {X x xs}.
Arguments there {X x y xs} _.
Check (there here) : 26 ∈ (43 :: 26 :: 76 :: nil).
